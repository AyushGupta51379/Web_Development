# Purpose

The purpose of these codes is to improve my d3 skills - Data Visualization for the web.
I am doing this by experimenting with codes from the book by Scott Murray. I am also adding a lot of comments in the code to make it easier to understand even without any reference.

# Description

These are my personally modifications & experiments on sample codes from the book “Interactive Data Visualization for the Web, Second Edition” by Scott Murray, published in July 2017 by O’Reilly.

# How to run the code?

## Use a server

You can either use a Python server or a WAMP or other server.

Python servers are the easiest.

## Installing Python - for server

You can find the latest version of Python 3.x from https://www.python.org/downloads/

Please download and install it if you would like to set up a server using Python (instead of other methods).

## Setting up python server

### Go to command line of your PC.

### Once python is installed, Go to the project directory

### Type: python -m http.server 9999
This will set up a server using python at the page: http://localhost:9999/

### Go to the webpage: http://localhost:9999/

### Now, you can easily see the files and open them

Now, you can open any .html file to see its code

# Enjoy!
