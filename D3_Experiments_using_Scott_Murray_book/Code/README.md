# Purpose

The purpose of these codes is to improve my d3 skills - Data Visualization for the web.
I am doing this by experimenting with codes from the book by Scott Murray. I am also adding a lot of comments in the code to make it easier to understand even without any reference.

# Description

These are my personally modified sample codes from the book “Interactive Data Visualization for the Web, Second Edition” by Scott Murray, published in July 2017 by O’Reilly.

## Version

**Important:** Make sure you are using the correct version of these sample files!  Otherwise, the code you see here may not exactly match what you see in the book.

This is version **2.0** of the examples, which should sync perfectly with what appears in the second edition. (Fingers crossed.)

For code shown in the **first edition of the book** (published March 2013), find version 1.0 on [the releases page](https://github.com/alignedleft/d3-book/releases).
