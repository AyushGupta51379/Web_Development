# How to run the code, to show website developed?

## First, Download the folder you want to render as webpage

## Use a server

You can either use a Python server or a WAMP or other server.

Python servers are the easiest.

## Installing Python - for server

You can find the latest version of Python 3.x from https://www.python.org/downloads/

Please download and install it if you would like to set up a server using Python (instead of other methods).

## Setting up python server

### Go to command line of your PC.

### Once python is installed, Go to the project directory

### Type: python -m http.server 9999
This will set up a server using python at the page: http://localhost:9999/

### Go to the webpage: http://localhost:9999/

### Now, you can easily see the files and open them as webpages

Now, you can open any .html file to see its code

# How to experiment with the code

## Use a text editor - You just need one - I currently prefer Sublime Text

Such as Sublime Text or Visual Studio. I am currently using Sublime Text. Notepad++ is okay for a start. You can use Notepad for basic HTML code.

# Enjoy!
