# How to run the code?

## Use a server

You can either use a Python server or a WAMP or other server.

Python servers are the easiest.

## Installing Python - for server

You can find the latest version of Python 3.x from https://www.python.org/downloads/

### Go to command line of your PC.

### Once python is installed, Go to the project directory

### Type: python -m http.server 9999

### Go to the webpage: http://localhost:9999/

### Now, you can easily see the files and open them
