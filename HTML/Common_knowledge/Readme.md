# Common Elements
There are hundreds of different HTML elements. Here are some of the most com‐
mon. 

## html
Surrounds all HTML content in a document.
## head
The document head contains all metadata about the document, such as its title
and any references to external stylesheets and scripts.
## title
The title of the document. Browsers typically display this at the top of the
browser window and use this title when bookmarking a page.
## body
Everything not in the head should go in the body. This is the primary visible con‐
tent of the page.
## h1, h2, h3, h4
These let you specify headings of different levels. h1 is a top-level heading, h2 is
below that, and so on.
## p
A paragraph!
## ul, ol, li
Unordered lists are specified with ul, most often used for bulleted lists. Ordered
lists (ol) are often numbered. Both ul and ol should include li elements to spec‐
ify list items.

## a
A link. Typically rendered as underlined, blue text, unless otherwise specified.
## div
An arbitrary division within the document. Used for grouping and containing
related elements.
## span
An arbitrary span of text, typically within a larger containing element like p.
## em
Indicates emphasis. Typically rendered in italics.
## strong
Indicates additional emphasis. Typically rendered in boldface.
