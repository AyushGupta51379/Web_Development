# HTML in 1 hour

Basic HTML skills for making websites and blogs. This section is mainly focused on HTML concepts, without adding much CSS. To improve these further, we can add CSS and JavaScript.\\\

# Steps to run the files

1. Download the files of index.html, blog.html and process.php
2. Open index.html and blog.html using any browser. I prefer Google Chrome, but you can use any other browser as well.
